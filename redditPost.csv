Columbia ($$$) vs Wharton for entrepreneurship,10,b70ixx,https://www.reddit.com/r/MBA/comments/b70ixx/columbia_vs_wharton_for_entrepreneurship/,9,"Hi!  


I feel super lucky to have been accepted to Wharton and CBS. I also received a $50k fellowship from columbia, so $100k over the two years. I got nothing from Wharton.  


A few factors to consider:  
\-In the long term, I want to go into entrepreneurship. It seems that Wharton has better resources for that, but it also would be helpful to graduate with less debt.  
\-I currently live in NYC, which is good and bad. I have a network here which could be helpful but also could be distracting from my MBA experience.   
\-Culturally, I liked Wharton better when I visited and really vibed well with the community.

GPA 3.2

GMAT: 690 47Q 39V    I am planning on taking again this spring aiming for 710 to 720

Major: Accounting      Minor: International Business

Undergrad ~ Boston College, Villanova, Lehigh, Bucknell

CPA Licensed

Work Experience:

1)  I spent the last 2.5 years as a Tax Associate at a Big 4 Firm in a Major US Market. I was promoted to Senior Associate in the Fall.  

2) This spring I will be switching to Big 4 Deal Advisory working on large scale M&A transactions. 

I plan on applying in September 2020 to the following schools:

1. NYU
2. Cornell 
3. Georgetown
4. I may throw an application into Columbia for the heck of it even tho I know its a complete reach

Extracurriculars: Not much to speak of. My tax group requires 80-90 hr weeks during busy season which lasts half the year. The time I wasn't in busy season I was focused on getting CPA, taking GMAT, and networking to get my new role. In my new role I will try to join an organization at the firm but wondering if lack of this will hurt me. In my opinion I think I really should focus on getting my GMAT up 20-30 points before worrying about extracurriculars. 

Goal of MBA:  To break into Ibanking but also floating the idea of consulting depending on what I like about my new role.

Assuming I get my target GMAT score do I have any realistic change of being accepted to one of my target schools? What if I don't get it? 

Any and all input is greatly appreciated.

Foster Full-ride vs Wharton,7,b6zl32,https://www.reddit.com/r/MBA/comments/b6zl32/foster_fullride_vs_wharton/,8,"Hey - want to start out by saying a big thank you to everyone on this sub. For someone who never considered getting an MBA this place has offered me helpful advice on everything from applications to loans. 

&#x200B;

I applied to (5) schools this year - H/S/W, Foster, and Tepper. 

&#x200B;

I currently work as a Technology Consultant for a Top 10 (non-MBB/B4) Firm, and am based in NYC. I love the firm, made great friends, learned a ton, and traveled extensively. However, my main desire in getting an MBA stems from my lack of interest in going up the ranks here. Most partners are in a good place, but the road to getting there was brutal, filled with divorces, ignored parenting responsibilities, and imbalance for most. I don't want that life. 

&#x200B;

A few of my friends that went the product management route post-college are enjoying relative stability - and it's a career I want to explore. My ambitions post-MBA are to land a Product Manager role at Google/Netflix/equivalent. 

&#x200B;

I went to an unknown liberal arts college, majored in history, taught English abroad for a year, scored a 700 on the GMAT, and have started a grassroots volunteering organization for at-risk youth in NYC - to give you an idea of my application. I am an ORM female. 

&#x200B;

Now... results. I got dinged immediately w/o interview at H/S, and was admitted to:

Wharton - 0 money

Foster - Full-ride

Tepper - Half-tuition

&#x200B;

I LOVED foster when I visited. Super intimate class, most interested in tech, and lots of resources to land PM roles. At Wharton, I felt really intimidated by the caliber of student, and the huge 800-some people class size, and I think only half of them were present for Welcome Weekend. I've pretty much ruled out Tepper because I didn't enjoy it both times that I went.

&#x200B;

Based on my career goals should I go with Foster? Or should I go with Wharton, knowing it will force me to grow and provide a better brand?

Accepted to three T20 programs with a 670 GMAT,81,b6pelt,https://www.reddit.com/r/MBA/comments/b6pelt/accepted_to_three_t20_programs_with_a_670_gmat/,19,"I never posted a profile review here, partially because I joined this sub after I decided which programs to apply to, but I wanted to share my advice for people with below average GMAT scores.

Quick profile: 28 F, White, 3.5 GPA for a 5 year architecture program at a top 60 private university, 670 GMAT, 5 years of work experience at a medium business process outsourcing company (~250 employees), one year in a leadership development program, 4 in tech. Want to be in the northeast after graduation.

I really struggled with the GMAT, which honestly surprised me because I did very well on the SATs.  I didn’t study enough the first two times I took it in May and September of 2018 and got a 640 both times. I decided to delay my application a year and joined the Forté MBALaunch program. I studied at least an hour a day for 5 months and was able to raise my score to a 670.  This score put me in the average GMAT range for a T20 school.

I was accepted to Tepper, McCombs, and Kenan-Flagler during round 2. Here’s my advice:

1. They publish an 80% range for a reason. If you fall in that 80% you have a decent shot of getting in with a strong application.

2. Work really hard on your essays. I used ApplicantLab and found it to be really helpful. I think my why MBA story was clear and realistic (transitioning from a quasi-technical role as a system administrator to a product manager at a software company). It also kept me organized while working on so many applications.

3. You should apply to at least 3 “match” schools that meet your short term goals if you’re 100% sure you want to get an MBA.  I’ve talked to people with a GMAT score like mine who applied to a mix of M7 and T15 schools, that’s not realistically setting yourself up for success. 

4. I highly recommend Forte MBALaunch. I got a ton of support from my peers and an application waiver from 4 out of 5 schools I applied to. That alone more than pays for the cost of the program.

I feel like a lot of what I see on this sub is around M7 and 700+ GMAT scores, but there’s a lot of ways to pursue an MBA and still get a ROI. I’ll be attending Tepper in the fall and I’m really excited! ",3/28/2019 18:36
Choosing Between 2 Part Time Programs and Debt,2,b71148,https://www.reddit.com/r/MBA/comments/b71148/choosing_between_2_part_time_programs_and_debt/,0,"I live in a state that isn't home to an elite b school. The two best programs in the state are the typical University of X and X State University. X State University's program will cost me $20k out of pocket while University of X's program would be $40k out of pocket. Within the state, University of X's program is generally viewed as better and ranks higher.

&#x200B;

I originally applied and was accepted to X State University's program because it was cheaper and I met the GPA requirement to waive the GMAT.

&#x200B;

The program starts in May, but I am starting to have second thoughts and wondering if I should shoot for the better of the two schools. I took a look at the part time class profile for University of X's part time program and my undergrad GPA was higher than their average and the GMAT wasn't too bad, I feel like I could get a score in the range with two months of studying. If I decided to wait and try and get into the other program, the $20k difference would be a factor, and I would have to take on debt to cover it.

&#x200B;

Full disclosure for advice purposes, my goal of completing the program is that I am looking to switch careers. I currently work in accounting (\~2 years of work experience) and am looking either to switch into HR or FP&A. I know for most folks, full-time is the go-to for switching careers, but for my interests, I don't think it is worth the opportunity cost.

&#x200B;

I guess I'm just having trouble deciding if it is worth waiting a year or so, going through the application process again, taking the GMAT, and potentially taking out the debt to attend the 'better' school. Part of me, thinks it isn't due to my career goals, but then I also think I might regret not trying to get into the better program.

I estimated 60 months of work experience in my application and if I quit in April it will be 59 months, which I don't consider a material difference. I'm just not sure if I quit in April and get lucky and get off the waitlist in May that it will cause problems with the background check. I do have plenty of work accomplishments from 2019 already that I can share with the adcom to help get off the waitlist if they ask for that.

MBA UofT ROTMAN VS. NYU STERN?,5,b6m5ue,https://www.reddit.com/r/MBA/comments/b6m5ue/mba_uoft_rotman_vs_nyu_stern/,8,"Seeking serious opinions here... :)

After rejected by Kellogg yesterday, my options are now limited to offers from Rotman and Stern, both FT. Currently I am a Canadian PR, still need to fulfill the 'living 3 out of 5 years' requirement to get the citizenship, that said, I have to return to Canada for work if I decide to attend Stern.

My career goal is to work in consulting and I will definitely work hard towards it (ideally MBB for sure, or Tier 2 S&O), but I know it is not easy to land a job at MBB based on the recent employment stats from Rotman. While Stern shows outstanding employment report, it is mainly US based. I am not sure if an MBA from Stern can help with my career in Canada, or will it even hurt because I won't be able to build up a strong network in Canada during the 2 years in school?

Option 2: Large annual diversity conference, great opportunity to meet more MBAs and exposure to a lot more alums and companies, but less small group type exposure, potentially.

1) statistically better recruiting in tech - but are these all good tech roles or ops/supply chain etc. Is it significantly better in the opportunities I'll have at these target companies? 

2) Location

3) Better ranking - but Yale brand does resonate more in Canada at least and not sure if it's only a matter of few years as Yale has great momentum

I was fortunate enough to secure two offers for full time programs next year: Kellogg with no scholarship and Anderson with a large fellowship ($100-$150k). I know this sub tends to highly value prestige and M7s, but I'm wondering if there's an argument for Anderson in this situation. Here's a little more info on me:

I know that UCLA punches above its rank when it comes to west coast tech. Then again, I also understand that Kellogg has sent a greater percentage of its class to west coast tech recently.

Looking at R1 for next year. This year I finished my GMAT super late and crunched out my apps in about 2 and half weeks. The results are as follows.

&#x200B;

Ross - Waitlisted

Duke - Rejected (Because my undergrad exchange transcript was really bad)

Tuck - Rejected - I messed up the interview timing and did not get an invite after

Wharton - Rejected

Kellogg - Rejected after interview

&#x200B;

I just want to get feedback on how to set my self up best for R1 in the fall this year. My vision/story was that I want to make changes in the transportation space coming from the auto sector. I believe there are a-lot of opportunity to good with the changing technology.

&#x200B;

For apps this fall: Perhaps start GMAT again as my GPA is really weak. As well, one weakness I believe is that my EC is not tied to my story. My goal is to get more involved with transportation related volunteer projects in the city and also look at how I can brand my self better in the auto space. As well, get more work accomplishments like doing consulting work for the dealerships.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Background**

* Work experience:

&#x200B;

Canadian based.

&#x200B;

7 years of automotive sector experience in various head office. Currently in a supervisory role - managing 1 person.  Started in marketing and moved into incentive planning: looking pricing incentive structure, market and competitive conditions. Currently in sales operations which sets new car sales targets for the organization and reviewing dealer performance and profitability.

&#x200B;

* Extra curricular:

&#x200B;

Last 3 years - New immigrant business coaching and new immigrant mentoring through a local non profit, which includes workshops on things like interviews,casing,presentations.

&#x200B;

Last year - Once a month I host a community dinner that brings strangers together of all backgrounds together to share stories. The goal is to connect new immigrants to established professionals and for people to share stories.

&#x200B;

Last 9 years - Long distance runner.

&#x200B;

Undergrad - DECA chapter president. I have a leadership award from my undergrad given to 40 students out of the 40K population.

&#x200B;

For next year I am thinking of getting involved in more transportation related volunteer opportunity which is coherent to my story.

&#x200B;

* Undergrad school/major: BBA

&#x200B;

* Other education/coursework:

&#x200B;

Lean Six Sigma Certification (not a belt, but a certification from a continue education program at a local university)

Power BI certification (Completing this April)

&#x200B;

* Race/nationality: Chinese-Canadian.
* Sex: Male

&#x200B;

**Stats**

* GMAT Score (include breakdown!): 730 (48Q/43V)

&#x200B;

* Undergrad GPA:

&#x200B;

3.1 from a major Canadian university.  BBA

&#x200B;

During undergrad I did an exchange that failed a course - this mark is not reflected in my transcript. However, there was a conflict in trying to get the transcript from the host university (the version they had on file was incorrect), this then turned into alot of emails between myself and Duke. Which I assume left a negative impression. (Duke was the only school that asked for my international transcript)

&#x200B;

**MBA Info**

&#x200B;

* Goal of MBA:

&#x200B;

Interested in Automotive consulting at Tier 1/Tier 2 consulting firm, and helping to tackle the transportation problems (congestion/city planning/electrification) in general. The industry it self is changing and being challenged by tech firms. I want to pivot and look at the industry from not just a vehicle sales perspective.

&#x200B;

* Target schools:

&#x200B;

For Round 1:

&#x200B;

Would love to to target again

Wharton - cause they have autonomous vehicle club along with a mobility innovation center

Tuck

Background

Work experience: Big4 advisory/management consulting in the Middle East, financial services vertical

Extra curriculars: Led firm wide initiatives for empowering female employees, volunteer in my city on a regular basis for the last 3 years, certified yoga instructor, fluent in 4 languages (including Arabic)

Undergrad school/major: Well regraded school in the region, Psychology major Economics minor

Other education/coursework: A couple of Excel certifications, passed Level 1 and Level 2 CFA

Race/nationality: International, Indian

Sex: Female, 24

Stats

GMAT Score (include breakdown!): 780 (47Q/49V) A little worried about my Quant score tbh!

Undergrad GPA: 3.8

MBA Info

Goal of MBA: The short story is towards the end of undergrad I found out I have an insane amount of interest in finance, so chased finance related projects throughout my time at B4 MC. Through those experiences realized an interest in PE related roles, so my main goal is to hit reset and transition into PE post MBA. All this is definitely quite vague, but that’s the gist of it. 
IB would be loads of fun too I think, though.

Target schools: Booth, Wharton, Stern, Sloan, Harvard, Stanford, Yale (though I’m not too optimistic about these last 3)

Any thoughts/advice is appreciated. I definitely need to work on my story and selling myself more in terms of why exactly I need an MBA, so thoughts on that would also be lovely.

Thanks!

I hope to begin my MBA in Autumn 2020 and figure I may as well reach out and begin garnering an understanding of my best path forward.

&#x200B;

TLDR: Engineer with good experience and I think I have a good story but a low GPA.  What are my chances?

&#x200B;

Gunning for good schools in Bay Area and NYC for personal reasons.

&#x200B;

**Background**

* Work experience:
   * At time of matriculation I will have four years of experience working as a Process Engineer of different levels at a single Biotechnology company in the Bay Area.
   * I started at the company as a Process Engineering Intern immediately after graduation and burned through all my savings in an attempt to get a full-time offer, and therefore a more permanent foothold in the US and the industry itself.  I was offered a full-time position as a Process Engineer after two months.  Two years later I was promoted to Senior Process Engineer, this is a substantially more senior position than people my age typically hold as I effectively jumped past Process Engineer II/III/IV.  There is a chance I will be promoted again prior to matriculation.
   * I was the fifth engineer hired at the company when it was still a small startup.  Over the past few years I have been part of the three person engineering team who has brought a product through FDA approval and into commercialization.  This product could potentially be a billion dollar product.  This is my companies first commercial product - a biotech startup having a product approved by the FDA is the equivalent of an IPO at tech companies.  I have watched, and assisted in, our company growing from a small startup into a medium sized and successful biotech company.
   * My job duties have been everything involved with highly technical management of a third party production site producing complex medicines. This has included moving to the area for multiple months at a time.  I am part of the team that manages the business relationship with this third party.
   * For the two years leading up to matriculation I will have been spending about 20% of my time working for the corporate development team helping them develop pliable marketing and financial models.  This is a role that I have sought out and have excelled at.
   * I will have glowing letters of recommendation from my boss, who is a Senior Director in a technical role and a bit of a rising star in the industry, as well as the Executive Director of Corporate Development.  Both have told me that they will write whatever needs to be written.
* Extra curriculars:
   * Volunteering:
      * Hosted a weekly radio show in university and was involved with public radio outreach.
      * Editor at a small music blog during university, involved with event and financial planning.
      * Volunteer three hours a week in a Big Brother type program.  At time of matriculation I will have been volunteering for 2.5 years.
   * For hobbies I surf and ski extensively.
* Undergrad school/major:
   * Prestigious Canadian University
   * Major: Biochemical Engineering, GPA 2.9
      * I understand that my GPA is sub par.  I think I have a good story though.  I never took a bird course as I geared all my free electives towards courses that I thought would help me get into Biotech (for which I knew I would need to move to the US). This, in combination with an exchange semester I did, resulted in an absolutely crushing Senior year where I took the equivalent of seven courses both semesters and had a Capstone Project/Thesis Project both semesters.  My GPA had been in an upward trajectory until then.  I feel vindicated as when I was interviewed my future boss actually commented on the array and breadth of my pertinent course load.
* Other education/coursework:
   * My company sponsored me to attend a week long short course at MIT in biotechnology.
* Race/nationality:
   * White/Canadian Citizen.
   * I am on an H1B Visa but  my company is currently sponsoring me for a Green Card
* Sex:
   * Male

**Stats**

* GRE Score:
   * I anticipate around 168 quant and 165 verbal
* Undergrad GPA:
   * 2.9 (see above)

**MBA Info**

* Goal of MBA:
   * The healthcare system in this country is broken and I want to do what I can to ease the financial burden on families as well as the system itself.  The company I currently work for prides itself in providing affordable therapies but I feel like I can have more of a positive impact in a strategic role at an early stage company.  I would love to help bring life changing therapies to patients.  Therefore I am particularly interested in working in Business Strategy at small biotech companies.
   * I believe an MBA in combination with my technical skills would be valuable at early stage biotech startups where employees need to fill many roles.
* Target schools:
   * NYU, CBS, Haas, Tuck, Duke, Anderson, Rotman (University of Toronto) as a backup
   * Are these realistic? Could I apply to even higher ranked schools?

Currently working in financial regulation/compliance, with aspirations in finance, IB or regulatory compliance at a big bank.

McDonough is the clear winner in terms of network, career opportunities, and a strong finance concentration. However, if I were to attend, the cost would be about two times as much as Smith, once factoring in scholarship, partial employer sponsorship, and loans. Smith’s name is recognizable in the DC area, but outside, it has very little pull compared to Georgetown. 

My ultimate goal is to be upper management/C-level in one of the aforementioned fields. However, ROI is also a huge factor for me in terms of actually making a feasible decision in terms of what my salary would be and the loans I would have to pay back.

Stern or Anderson? No $,9,b5town,https://www.reddit.com/r/MBA/comments/b5town/stern_or_anderson_no/,7,"Hi all,

I have been accepted to both Stern and Anderson. I am looking to transition from nonprofit-tech to private sector-tech with roles focused on product management. I am originally from NYC and currently living in the Midwest. Long-term I am open to living on either the West Coast or moving back to the Northeast. 

&#x200B;

Re. Stern

I really loved NYU Stern when I visited and could picture myself on campus. Also, being in NYC and having access to so many different tech companies just train stops away is a huge draw for me as I navigate the tech scene more. Stern's part-time MBA program is also a huge network to tap into. Stern's communication throughout the process and after admission has been stellar compared to Anderson's. 

Re. Anderson

I will be visiting Anderson in the upcoming weeks to see if I can see myself attending school there. While I know the tech scene in LA is huge, multiple people I have spoken pointed out to me that a majority of companies are still in the Silicon Valley area. This would require more planning for company visits and events, as opposed to hopping on the subway in NYC. 

&#x200B;

I am having a hard time deciding as both seem to be similarly recognized and ranked schools. Neither has offered a scholarship and Stern is about $20k more per school year. I am assuming that living expenses will be similar in both areas.

**Stats**: 3.5 / 780 GMAT / 179 LSAT (out of 180) / 6 years WE

**Background**: 

* Engineering undergrad from a top 5 school

* Solo founded and bootstrapped a successful tech startup (8 fig revenue), largest in niche

* 6mo consulting (recent) for a legal tech startup with very significant contributions made

* Glowing letters of rec

* Guaranteed yield for H/MIT due to *strong* reasons to stay in Boston (can you tell from my app list?)

**Apps ranked in order of preference at start of cycle**

Name | Result | Submitted
---|---|----|----
HBS | Rejected w/o interview | 9/4/18
MIT Sloan | Interviewed, WL | 9/4/18
HLS | **Accepted, attending** | 10/28/18
BU Law | Accepted ($$$), withdrawn | 10/28/18
BC Law | WL, withdrawn | 10/28/18

My ambitions are related to legal tech and my original goal was a JD/MBA at H. I applied in the first round of admissions and thought I had an extremely strong app due to my WE and GMAT but that didn't stop HBS from giving me a big, crimson, round 1 dong. MIT followed that up by raising my hopes with an interview invite (which went horribly) and then dashing them with a WL. It left me shook. My professional identity revolved around 'conducting business'. How come he don't want me?

Happily, HLS swooped in and saved the day after months of radio silence. I'm super excited to attend and I've rationalized that I can accomplish my goals just as well with 'only' a JD. Business is mostly handwaving and bullshit anyway and H is going to open a lot of doors for me.

Unorganized thoughts:

* I'm still baffled by my bschool results but I guess that's why people blanket the M7. You never know what's going to happen. 

* The bschool app procedure is much more respectful of applicants. There are hard deadlines and all results are released simultaneously, by email, on a predetermined date. As much as I appreciate the human touch of an acceptance phone call, waiting for law school rolling admissions feels like shit.

* Don't get cocky. I didn't let it leak through to my apps, but I thought I was a shoo-in. All the top schools have enough highly qualified candidates that they can ding you just to flex.

* In hindsight, the LSAT prep materials were way better and I **highly** recommend using LSAT material for reading comp and critical reasoning. It might have bumped me up to a 790.

* /r/lawschooladmissions is a really cool community. There's more naivety, but I really liked the friendliness and way that they shared advice.

From what I can tell consulting is an incredibly difficult job with great pay and exit opportunities. It seems like most people tend to hate consulting and people seem to pursue it out of financial obligation and the strength of the exit opportunities. I'm also aware that there is probably a bias to the accounts I see online as people who enjoyed their experience are less likely to write glowing write-ups on the internet for all to see. I've been interested in pursuing consulting, but I'm wondering if my plans are misguided and I should reconsider.

  
For those who went into consulting, what did you make of the experience? Would you have followed the same path if you had full-tuition and could afford to recruit into lower salary positions? If not consulting what other paths would you have pursued?",3/25/2019 14:37

Scholarship Offer Timing?,3,b5mv9i,https://www.reddit.com/r/MBA/comments/b5mv9i/scholarship_offer_timing/,6,"Hey Everyone.

&#x200B;

I'm elated to have received 3 acceptances (1 pending), but no information regarding a potential scholarship was mentioned during the phonecalls/on the acceptance emails, and I couldn't find any information on my internal portal.

&#x200B;

Am I supposed to interpret this as no scholarship or are scholarships sent out at a later date?

Thanks!",3/26/2019 3:47
[Poets & Quants] Thousands of Students Forced to Attend Chico State After University Sets Acceptance Rate to 140%,27,b5edv0,https://www.reddit.com/r/MBA/comments/b5edv0/poets_quants_thousands_of_students_forced_to/,4,"Chico, CA – In part of an ongoing effort to foster a more inclusive academic community, thousands of students from across the nation were forced to attend Chico State Monday after the university set its acceptance rate to 140 percent.  “We’d like to congratulate all the people who didn’t apply, but were nevertheless determined to obtain the clout of the Chico MBA,” said university president Gayle Hutchinson, who noted that hundreds of required admissions letters were still in the mail, and that those not yet accepted should not lose hope of matriculating this Fall.  “The class of 2021 will almost certainly be the most diverse and accomplished cohort in the history of Chico State.  In fact, we were quite surprised by the number of international students we were able to prod onto planes.  We look forward to meeting you all at our Welcome Weekend where we can assign you your internship, club, and employer.”  At press time, Hutchinson confirmed that the university would not be offering any scholarships or fellowships, but promised that each student would love their personally embroidered Chico backpack.",3/25/2019 14:27
